### Week 1: Lesson 1 ###

**Introduction:** What is machine learning?

Grew out of work with AI

Examples of when it's used:

1. Database Mining: Because of the growth of automation (and the internet) we now have massive datasets, rich in information. A few examples: web-click data fron the internet, scientific data: astronomy and genomic datasets, medical record. Basically the data all around us.

2. Applications that can't be programmed: e.g. autonomous helicopters taht need to train themselves how to fly, handwriting recognition, nearly all Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, computer vision - identification.

3. Self-customising programs: eg. Amazon, Netflix or supermarket product recommendations.

Two definitions of Machine Learning are offered. Arthur Samuel described it as: "the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." This is an older, informal definition.

Tom Mitchell provides a more modern definition: "A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E."

Example: playing checkers.
E = the experience of playing many games of checkers
T = the task of playing checkers.
P = the probability that the program will win the next game.
In general, any machine learning problem can be assigned to one of two broad classifications: Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning.
